I recently completed my Ph.D. in applied mathematics at UCLA where I was extremely fortunate to be advised by [Deanna Needell](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~deanna/). This year, I am postdoc in the computer science department at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) under the supervision of [David Woodruff](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/). Previously I completed my undergrad degrees at UT Austin in mathematics and computer science.
